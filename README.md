# ART_GALLERY_PROJECT_CODE

#### Data analysis of ART GALLERY with the ARTIST & their ARTWORK 

## Project Overview :

#### The Art Gallery Database is a structured MySQL project designed to manage and analyze information related to artists, museums, artworks, and their subjects. This database provides a comprehensive system for storing, retrieving, and querying art-related data efficiently. It enables users to explore various aspects of the art world, such as artist details, museum locations, artwork styles, and thematic subjects.

## Project Objectives :

#### Develop a structured relational database to store and manage art-related information efficiently.

#### Facilitate quick retrieval of data using optimized SQL queries.

#### Establish relationships between artists, museums, and artworks to provide meaningful insights.

#### Enable complex queries and analysis to explore trends in art styles and museum collections.

#### Implement many-to-many relationships to accurately reflect real-world associations between artists, museums, and subjects.

#### Ensure data integrity and consistency using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

#### Provide a scalable database schema that can be extended for future enhancements like web integration or analytics.
